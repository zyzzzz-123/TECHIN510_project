# 🎯 GoalAchiever: LLM-Powered Goal Planner for Students

## 🌟 Overview
**GoalAchiever** is an AI-powered productivity tool that helps college students break down long-term goals into actionable daily tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). It intelligently fits those tasks into their existing schedule, helping them reclaim wasted time and turn it into meaningful self-improvement.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Many students unintentionally spend hours on social media or aimless scrolling. Meanwhile, long-term goals like learning a new skill, preparing for a career, or personal growth often get pushed aside. GoalAchiever bridges that gap by:

- Analyzing daily routines
- Suggesting personalized goals
- Planning achievable steps into their calendar
- Tracking progress and adapting along the way

---

## 👥 Target Audience
College students who feel lost, overwhelmed, or under-motivated—but want to make better use of their time to grow academically, personally, or professionally.
